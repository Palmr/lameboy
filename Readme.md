# Lameboy

Yet another Game Boy emulator.

This emulator is a rust learning project for me. It currently isn't aiming to be the most accurate emulator, the fastest
 or the one with the best code. It's just here as something fun for me to play with while learning how to use rust.

## Current Status

Currently just about loads non-MBC roms and has plenty of issues. But it can show the background, which is a start.

Plenty of debug windows are implemented which helps track down issues as they come up.
